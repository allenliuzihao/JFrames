JFrames
---------------------------------------------------
Creator: Zihao Liu

Description
---------------------------------------------------

JFrames is a lightweight open source Java images/video processing library for developers who are working with frame by frame image processing with videos. Some techniques include changing image from RGB color space to other color space such as YUV, motion tracking between consecutive video frames, and calculating correlation between images' color space.

I created this project a while back when I was an undergraduate student at UW-Madison. I was working on a related project in computer vision about face blurring that ended up using some modules in this project. If you want to learn more about that project and algorithmic details about frame-by-frame template matching in JFrames, I uploaded those official reports in the report folder.

Requirements
---------------------------------------------------
- Java compiler compliance level: 1.6 & 1.7

Installation
---------------------------------------------------
Get the source and import it as Java library project in the eclipse

Usage
---------------------------------------------------
To process an individual image, first initialize ProcessImage class

    $  ProcessImage p = new ProcessImage(url);		//url is absolute (or relative) path for image

Or

    $  ProcessImage p = new ProcessImage(img);		//img is BufferedImage as specified by official java doc

To process an entire set of frames (note each image name must be of form "frame1.jpg" etc), use ProcessFrame class

	$  ProcessFrames p = new ProcessFrames(url);		//url is absolute (or relative) path for folder containing frames


Then you could do operations such as stroke rectangle on image, convert image to YUV color space, get only image with Y
component, or UV component, get correlation between two images, and output an image to a specified path.
